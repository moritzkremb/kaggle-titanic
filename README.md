# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction using ML

This is my attempt at testing some Machine Learning algorithms using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. I use a Jupyter Notebook and go through the data analysis and prediction step by step. You can use this Notebook if you're a beginner in ML and want to get a first taste for doing data analysis with Kaggle datasets.

## Dependencies

I recommend using conda to install all the required packages. You'll need the following packages:
+ numpy
+ scikit-learn
+ pandas
+ matplotlib

## Method

The aim is to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers, using the available data.

1. We first get familiar with the data.
2. We use a simple Decision Tree model to do our first prediction.
3. We use a Random Forest model to do another prediction.
4. Planning on adding another Neural Network model.
